# **Omar Khawaja** VR Astrophysics Project

Here I will be uploading my project files. I will do my best to keep files organised, and will upload the final version of my scripts closer to the end of the Project as I will be making continous changes.
Note: *Sicne I have a lot of files, it may be easier for me to upload everything to the my own Git Respository near the end - TBC.*

# *Scripts*
### Initial Velocity 

```
SetInitialOrbitalVelocity.sc
``` 

* Calculates and sets the intial velocity. 

My old script has been attached for reference. 

### Gravity 

```
Gravity.sc
